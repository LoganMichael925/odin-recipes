  <h3>Description</h3>
  <p>One of my favorite recipes because of the nice cream 
    sauce and dark meat chicken. A classic French recipe.</p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>3 tablespoons olive oil</li>
      <li>4 bone-in chicken thighs with skin</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon Italian seasoning</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon minced garlic</li>
      <li>1 (6 ounce) package portobello mushroom caps</li>
      <li>1 tomato, sliced</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons white cooking wine, or to taste</li>
      <li>1 cup heavy whipping cream</li>
      <li>1/4 cup shredded Gruyere cheese</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon cornstarch</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon water</li>
      <li>1 cup chopped sweet onion</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
      <li><p>Heat olive oil in a nonstick pot over medium heat. 
        Add chicken thighs, Italian seasoning, and garlic; cook 
        until chicken is browned on both sides, about 5 minutes per 
        side. Mix mushrooms and tomato into chicken mixture; reduce 
        heat, cover pot, and cook until mushrooms are softened, 
        about 30 minutes.</p></li>
      <li><p>Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). 
        Grease a baking dish.</p></li>
      <li><p>Drain accumulated juices from chicken-mushroom-tomato mixture 
        into a separate saucepan and transfer chicken-mushroom-tomato 
        mixture to the prepared baking dish.</p></li>
      <li><p>Pour wine into saucepan with juices and bring to a boil. 
        Add cream and Gruyere cheese; cook and stir until cheese is melted 
        and sauce is smooth, 3 to 4 minutes.</p></li>
      <li><p>Stir cornstarch and water together in a small bowl 
          until cornstarch is dissolved; mix into cream sauce until 
          smooth and thickened. Pour sauce over chicken-vegetable 
          mixture; top with onion.</p></li>
      <li><p>Bake in the preheated oven until chicken is no longer 
        pink in the center, about 30 minutes. An instant-read 
        thermometer inserted near the bone should read 165 degrees 
        F (74 degrees C).</p></li>
    </ol>
