  <h3>Description</h3>
  <p>Also known as eggplant curry, This is a very simple, 
    quick and more importantly authentic Indian side dish 
    of grilled eggplant and tomato. Best served with naan or roti. 
    It should have a consistency of, um, well, 'mush' when 
    finished, but it's good.</p>
